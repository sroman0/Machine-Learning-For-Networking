## Course Overview

The *"Machine Learning for Networking"* course focuses on the intersection of **machine learning (ML)** and **networking**, providing students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The primary goal is to understand how ML techniques can be leveraged to solve complex networking problems, particularly in the **cybersecurity** domain.

### âœ… Key Learning Objectives:
- Develop proficiency in **Python** programming for ML applications.
- Understand and implement **data preprocessing** and **feature extraction** techniques.
- Apply **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** methods to networking datasets.
- Explore **anomaly detection** and **traffic classification** for network security.
- Analyze real-world **internet measurements** and **network traffic data**.

    "## 2. Exercise - Neural networks for classifying service of TCP flow logs\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset 'log_tcp_complete_classes.txt' contains traffic information generated by an open-source passive network monitoring tool called **tstat**. It automates the collection of packet statistics of traffic aggregates, using real-time monitoring features. Being a passive tool, the typical usage scenario is live monitoring of Internet links, in which all transmitted packets are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of TCP, Tstat identifies a new flow start when it observes a TCP three-way handshake. Similarly, it identifies a TCP flow end either when it sees the TCP connection teardown, or when it doesnâ€™t observe packets for some time (idle time). \n",
    "A flow is defined by a unique link between the sender and receiver, e.g., a tuple of <em>(IP_Protocol_Type, IP_Source_Address, Source_Port, IP_Destination_Address, Destination_Port)</em>. For a specific flow, tstat calculates a number of statistics of all the packets transmitted over this flow, and then generates a log for such flow with multiple attributes (statistics). \n",
    "\n",
    "A log file is arranged as a simple table where each column is associated to specific information and each row reports the flow during a connection. The log information is a summary of the flow properties. For instance, in the TCP log we can find columns like the starting time of a TCP connection, its duration, the number of sent and received packets, the observed Round Trip Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you need to predict the service the client connected to in each flow, given the features of the TCP connection. The ``class:207`` is our label, and contains 10 different services, such as ``amazon`` and ``google``\n"

    "### 2.1 Dataset pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the dataset, there are some categorical features (columns): ``#31#c_ip:1, c_port:2, s_ip:15, s_port:16, con_t:42, p2p_t:43, http_t:44, p2p_st:59, http_res:113, c_tls_SNI:116, s_tls_SCN:117, c_npnalpn:118, s_npnalpn:119, fqdn:127, dns_rslv:128``, in which ``#31#c_ip:1, c_port:2, s_ip:15, s_port:16, c_tls_SNI:116, s_tls_SCN:117, fqdn:127`` are required to be dropped.\n",
    "2. The column ``class:207`` is our label and it is also a categorical one, and you need to convert it to numerical labels to represent different connections. You can refer to:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "le = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "le.fit_transform(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Perform a stratified segmentation to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, with a portion of 1%, 9%, and 90%. We are choosing a very small portion for training set to make the training faster for this exercise. In general, it is not a good idea to use just 1% of samples for training.\n",
    "4. For the rest of categorical features (columns) that remain in the dataset, you need to use one-hot encoding to convert the categories, by using ``OneHotEncoder`` to replace the original categorical features to one-hot features. Specifically, the function will compute the number of distinct categories, and then generate as many 0/1 variables (columns) as there are different categories. For example, if a feature has 3 distinct values, you will end up with 3 columns with 0 and 1 in the form of (0,0,1), (0,1,0), and (1,0,0), in which each tuple represents one of the original categories. Specifically:\n",
    "    - You can record the numerical index of the remaining categorical columns in the original dataframe\n",
    "    - After performing data segmentation, you end up with numpy arrays. Since you know which columns represent categorical features according to the previous step, you can first generate one-hot features of training set and then delete original categorical features, combining remaining numerical features and one-hot features: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n",
    "enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore') # specify that you ignore possible unseen categories\n",
    "enc.fit(X_train[:, idx_columns_categorical_needed])\n",
    "features_enc_train = enc.transform(X_train[:, idx_columns_categorical_needed]).toarray()\n",
    "... = np.delete(...)\n",
    "... = np.concatenate([..., ...])\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - The ```OneHotEncoder``` needs to be fitted on training set, and then transform validation and test set. For each dataset, you need to remove the original categorical features.\n",
    "5. Standardize the dataset as always, fitting the scalar on training set and then trasforming the entire dataset.\n",
    "6. Convert your data to tensors."
